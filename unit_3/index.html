<p> Seymour's Eyeglass Emporium was founded in 1963 in Philadelphia by a young, near-sighted squirrel who could never seem to find enough acorns to store away for the winter. Fueled by a hunger for a better life, (and also the lack of acorns), he constructed his first set of eyeglasses from a broken marble he found in Rittenhouse Square. </p>
<p>Though unorthodox in appearance and design, Seymour's eyeglasses literally gave him a new outlook on life. It was there that his empire was born. He never forgot his roots, however, and the Seymour Winston Squirrel Foundation provides free eyeglasses to low-income squirrels in several major cities across the United States to this day.</p>
