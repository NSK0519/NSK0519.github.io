<p> Seymour's Eyeglass Emporium<strong> was founded in 1963 in Philadelphia by a young, near-sighted squirrel who could never seem to find enough acorns to store away for the winter. Fueled by a hunger for a better life, (and also the lack of acorns), he constructed his first set of eyeglasses from a broken marble he found in Rittenhouse Square. </p>
<p>Though unorthodox in appearance and design, Seymour's eyeglasses literally gave him a new outlook on life. It was there that his empire was born. He opened a small shop on Vine Street and gave away an acorn with every purchase. As the issue of squirrel myopia became something that was discussed openly, more and more customers made their way to his store. Over the next ten years, Seymour opened 14 stores across the nation. He never forgot his roots, however, and the Seymour Winston Squirrel Foundation provides free eyeglasses to low-income squirrels in several major cities across the country to this day.</p>
<p>Every single pair of Seymour's glasses, and our patented Seymour Shades is proudly made in the United States by our talented team of squirrels using the most adorably tiny tools you've ever seen.</p>
